# Mathematica-Notebooks
A collection of musings in Mathematica

This is a collection of Mathematica notebooks from the last several years, 
mostly consisting of scratch work, prototypes, and playing around.

I have no idea how much stuff is really in this collection, but a quick `grep` 
gives at least 32,780 cells.

Here are a few of my favorite graphics, in no particular order:

It's pretty messy, but here it all is for posterity (except a couple big ones, Github didn't accept them).
